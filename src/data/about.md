# Intro

A Full-Stack Developer passionate about building seamless user experiences and scalable web applications. I transitioned from in-person development jobs to freelancing to collaborate with people from different countries and backgrounds. So far, I’ve worked with clients from 10 different countries, gaining diverse experiences in building scalable and high-performing applications.

With a strong foundation in React, Redux, Tailwind, Firebase, Node.js, and Express, I specialize in crafting intuitive and efficient solutions. Lately, I’ve been diving deeper into Python and TensorFlow to explore AI-driven technologies and expand my problem-solving toolkit.

Whether it’s shipping production-ready features, optimizing workflows, or architecting efficient systems, I thrive on solving complex problems and collaborating with talented teams to create impactful software. Let’s build something awesome together!

# Some History

- I got my first laptop when I was 14. It was a game-changer, and I instantly fell in love with technology. Growing up in Ethiopia, access to tech was limited, but that laptop opened up a whole new world. I spent my time exploring everything from basic computing to experimenting with software and games, constantly pushing it to its limits to get the best out of it.

- At 15, I built my first website using simple HTML and CSS. It was a basic page, but it sparked my interest in web development, which would later become my career. I spent my free time watching tutorials, learning new languages, and building small projects.

- It wasn’t until I got to AAIT University that I started diving into JavaScript, and that's when things really started clicking. By then, my passion for coding had grown, and I began experimenting with more advanced technologies.

- By 18, I decided to take the leap and pursue a career in tech. I enrolled in a coding bootcamp that expanded my knowledge of web development and opened the doors to a freelance career.
